These notes have been prepared for CS111: Introduction to Computational Science. They highlight the pivotal role that computers play in solving complex mathematical models and demonstrate how advanced mathematical techniques can be harnessed to tackle real-world problems.

These notes draw inspiration from the CS192A: Matrix Analysis and Computation lecture notes by Prof. Shivkumar Chandrasekaran, a course that covers graduate-level linear algebra for Engineering and Computer Science at UCSB. I have incorporated many of the concepts from those notes and adapted them to be more accessible for upper-undergraduate students, with a particular emphasis on practical applications in linear algebra.

The primary goal of these notes is to bridge the gap between rigorous mathematical theory and computational practice. By emphasizing real-world applications in areas such as machine learning and bioinformatics, we illustrate how fundamental mathematical ideas underpin the algorithms and models that drive modern computational science.

For those seeking further insight and a deeper dive into scientific computing, I highly recommend exploring the excellent notes by David Bindel.
